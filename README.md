# Practical-Parenting-Android-App
An android application where users, namely parents, can use to schedule tasks, enforce timeouts, and overall add some respite to their daily lives. It was completed as a class project.

It has various features, which include: an option where you can add your list of children, and also assign a picture for each.
Also, you can add a list of tasks, which will cycle between the children; thus you can easily know which child's turn it is for doing the particular chore.
There is also a timeout timer; which works as an alarm using android service functions; sending a notification once a child's timeout has finished being enforced.
The application also has a "breathe in, breathe out" feature, where you can hold a circle inside the app, and an animated circle inflates like a balloon.

An image of the main menu is included in the repository.
